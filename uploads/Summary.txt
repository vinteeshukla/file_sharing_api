-Overview of the project falcon 9:

SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones.
It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.


-This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.
Perform exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering using Pandas and Matplotlib.

-Project has created a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land.
Performed exploratory Data Analysis and determined Training Labels,created a column for the class,standardized the data and splited into training data and test data.

-I have done this project as a data analyst and completed in 3 months.I have discovered many interesting insights related to the launch sites' location using folium, in a very interactive way.
